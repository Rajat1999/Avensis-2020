                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p class="rule">Plan of Action for line following bot Event Details about the event: 1. A line
                        follower robot is
                        basically a robot designed to follow a ‘line’ or path predetermined by the programmer. 2. This
                        line or path may be as simple as a physical white line on the floor or as complex path as per
                        marking schemes e.g. embedded lines, magnetic markers and laser guide markers. 3. In order
                        to detect these specific markers or ‘lines’, various sensing schemes can be employed. 4. These
                        schemes may vary from simple low cost line sensing circuit to expensive and sophisticated
                        vision systems. 5. From the industrial point of view, line following robot has been implemented
                        in semi to fully autonomous plants.
                    </p>

                    <h4>CHALLENGE STATEMENT</h4>
                    <p class="rule">build an autonomous robot which is capable of following a line. This line can be a
                        white line on
                        a black background or a black line on a white background .The robot will cover the track
                        following this line.
                    </p>

                    <h4>TASK</h4>
                    <p class="rule">The autonomous robot will begin its run from an initial marked position in a dark
                        isolated
                        room. It will follow the line strip beneath it and would cover the track. The robot has to
                        decide its path by sensing the line. The objective is to cover the entire track in least
                        possible time with sufficient accuracy</p>

                    <h4>ROUNDS</h4>
                    <p class="rule">ROUND 1:<br />1. There will be a single track.<br />2. There is no such limit on the
                        time of
                        completion of the bot run however the team which completes the run in minimum time
                        qualifies for the next round.<br />
                        3. Maximum of 8 hand touches (but with time penalty) and one hand pick (with extra time
                        penalty) is allowed throughout the round in order to adjust its position if it is heading
                        wrong.<br />
                        4. There will be one checkpoint and if it gets skipped, additional penalty will be charged
                        accordingly.<br />5. The team cannot make any programming changes in the course once the bot
                        starts its run.<br />6. Calibration time will be provided before the competition .<br />
                        ROUND 2: <br />1. Track complexity increases this time.<br />2. Each team will have maximum of 5
                        minutes to complete the track. <br />3. Maximum of 6 hand touches (but with penalty) and 2 hand
                        picks (with extra penalty) are allowed throughout the round in order to adjust its position if
                        it is
                        heading wrong. <br />4. There will be four checkpoints and maximum two can be skipped but
                        penalty will be charged accordingly. <br />5. The team cannot make any programming changes in
                        the course once the bot starts its run.</p>

                    <h4>Main Rules and Regulations of Event</h4>
                    <p class="rule">1. Decision of chief organizers and event heads is final and every participant has
                        to accept
                        it. <br />2. Round 1 is completing the track efficiently and in less time. <br />3. Clearing
                        round 1 in an
                        average minimum stipulated time ensures qualification to the next round. <br />4. Each team can
                        have maximum of 4 members.<br />
                        5. Each team should have unique participants i.e. it cannot have
                        any common member.<br />
                        6. Cross college teams are allowed. 7. The Right spirit of participation and discipline (during
                        the competition) is expected from the participants.
                    </p>

                    <h4>EVENT</h4>
                    <p class="rule">1. There will be a line present in the arena. This line can be white on black
                        background or black
                        on white background. <br />2. The thickness of line will not be the same. <br />3. The track
                        will have breaks
                        in it i.e. gaps. <br />4. In case the robot is not able to cross the gap they can reposition it
                        but marks
                        will be deducted for it.</p>

                    <h4>RESTART AND TIMEOUT</h4>
                    <p class="rule">1. A maximum of 1 Timeouts of 5 Minutes each may be taken in the second round only.
                        <br />2. A
                        penalty will be rewarded for each Timeout taken by the team and the robots will start from the
                        start zone. <br />3. The participants can have a maximum of 2 restarts for rounds. A penalty
                        will be

                    <h4>Objective</h4>
                    <p class="rule">The robots ( ultrasonic sensor controlled) will have to start from one end of the
                        maze, make the required turns and move till the far end of the maze in minimun time and with
                        minimum penalties possible. Robots will have to qualify first round so as to make their way for
                        the final maze i.e., final round</p>

                    <h4>Details of the event</h4>
                    <p class="rule">1. A Robo Maze comprises of a sensor controlled robot which tracks the correct path
                        in maze and completes it.<br />
                        2. It detects obstacles with the help of its sensors and hence moves in a different
                        direction.<br />
                        3. Various changes can be made in the working code of the robot to overcome various complexities
                        in the maze.<br />
                        4. The competition is conducted in such a way that the best bot which solves all the
                        complexities of the maze in the minimum time wins.
                    </p>

                    <h4>ROUNDS</h4>
                    <p class="rule">Round 1:<br />
                        1. Round 1 comprises of a basic maze which tests through some of the complexities.<br />
                        2. The track is a simple unidirectional maze, and a few pockets.<br />
                        3. The participants clearing the round 1 with maximum score will move toward the round 2 of the
                        event.<br />
                        4. The number of qualifying teams will be decided by the number of teams partipating.<br />

                        Round 2:<br />
                        1. This round will have higher level of difficulty than round 1.<br />
                        2. This round will be knockout tournament, the winning team goes ahead and the losing team goes
                        home.<br />
                        3. Time penalty would be imposed more strictly.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Rules and Regulations</h4>
                    <p class="rule">1. Decision of the organisers is final and binding, though appeals will be
                        entertained.<br />
                        2. Each team can have a maximum of 4 members.<br />
                        3. Each team should have unique particiants i.e, they cannot have any common members.<br />
                        4. Cross college teams are allowed.<br />
                        5. The right spirit of participation and discipline (during the competition) is expected from
                        the participants.<br />
                        6. After the maze is revealed, teams will have limited time to make the required
                        modifications.<br />
                        7. Time penalties will be given in cases like hand touch, hand pick, etc. These
                        penalties are decided by the organisers and are revealed at the time of event.<br />
                        8. Checkpoints are present of both tracks. Team can reset their bot at checkpoint but with some
                        penalty.<br />
                        9. 1st and 2nd team will be decided by the final match of round 2.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Disqualification</h4>
                    <p class="rule">Only sensor controlled (IR sensor or ultrasonic sensor) can participate. Remote
                        controlled bots will not be allowed.<br />
                        *The right to disqualify participating teams resides with Event Heads.<br />
                        The participants are requested to have a healthy competition, with sportmanship and positive
